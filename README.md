What it does
Our product, Sunny Glasses, is a pair of glasses that can record the user's sign language and then interpret, translate, and speak the sign language into english. Sunny Glasses also can turn speech to text for the user to see as subtitles. This means that a deaf person who only knows sign language can now speak to, and understand speech from someone who does not know sign language.
